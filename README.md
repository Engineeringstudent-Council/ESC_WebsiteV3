# ESC_WebsiteV3

Version #3 of the Engineering Student Council Website. The overall design was to be simple and be a stable source for organizations to receive information about finances and room bookings. The design and structure of the website was built by the 2014 ESC Web Developers. 

## Benefits:
- Simple
- Showed relevant information for ESC-affiliated organizations
- low maintenance (usually update just the Exec file for each semester)

## Downsides:
- Did not help students
- UX feedback showed that people did not take the ESC seriously
- basic website for an organization that does a lot 
- Did not give organizations much information besides ESC-related finance and facilities
